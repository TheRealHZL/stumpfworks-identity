# Signed client updates

`sw-badge-client-updater` supports mutually exclusive verification and installation modes. Installation is restricted to signed packages, compiled-in component targets, new absolute staging and rollback directories, atomic file replacement and mandatory service health checks.

An update ZIP contains exactly:

- `manifest.json`
- `manifest.sig`, a base64 Ed25519 signature over the exact manifest bytes
- one `payload/<component>` entry for every manifest file

The schema records release version, channel (`development` or `stable`), target OS/architecture, minimum client version, creation time, and the exact size and SHA-256 digest of every component. Component names come from a fixed allowlist; paths, commands and installation destinations cannot be supplied by a package.

`update-packager` creates Ed25519 key pairs and signed packages. Development and stable releases must use separate keys. The private key must live outside the repository on a restricted release workstation and must never be copied to LOGIN01 or a client. The public key is the only key installed on clients. Key and package output paths are create-only and existing files are never overwritten.

Example development key generation and package creation:

```bash
update-packager --generate-key \
  --private-key /secure/offline/development-update-ed25519.key \
  --public-key /secure/offline/development-update-ed25519.pub

update-packager \
  --private-key /secure/offline/development-update-ed25519.key \
  --output stumpfworks-client-1.2.0-linux-amd64.zip \
  --release 1.2.0 \
  --channel development \
  --architecture linux-amd64 \
  --minimum-version 1.2.0-dev \
  --component sw-badge-client-status=./sw-badge-client-status
```

Verification rejects unknown manifest fields, trailing JSON, duplicate or unlisted ZIP entries, unsafe paths, unsupported components, malformed versions, wrong architecture, excessive sizes, invalid hashes and invalid signatures. The release public key is provided separately as a base64 Ed25519 key. A private release key must never be installed on LOGIN01 or a client and must never be committed.

Example dry run:

```bash
sw-badge-client-updater \
  --dry-run \
  --package stumpfworks-client-1.2.1-linux-amd64.zip \
  --public-key /etc/stumpfworks-badge/update-release.pub
```

An optional `--stage-dir` extracts verified components into a new mode-restricted directory and writes `stage-plan.json`. Existing directories are never overwritten. The plan contains only fixed component-to-target mappings compiled into the updater, expected modes and whether a future installation would require a LightDM restart. Payload hashes are checked again while staging to close the verification-to-extraction gap. Staging never writes to an installation target.

Rollback preparation uses the fixed stage plan to copy only known existing target files into a new mode `0700` directory. Each saved file is mode `0600`, hashed, size-limited and recorded in `rollback.json`; targets that did not previously exist are recorded explicitly. Symlinks, special files, duplicate components, changed target mappings and existing rollback directories are rejected.

The internal restore implementation validates the complete manifest and every backup before changing any target. Existing files are restored through same-directory atomic replacements; files recorded as previously absent are removed. A restore can be rerun safely after an injected mid-restore failure. Restore is not exposed through the CLI yet, and package installation remains disabled until installation failure tests invoke this restore automatically.

The installation transaction revalidates the complete staged payload, creates the rollback snapshot, prepares replacement files and atomically replaces fixed targets. Any preparation or application error invokes rollback automatically. A successful transaction requires a non-optional post-install health callback; a failed health result restores the old files after proving that the new files were visible to the check. Failure-injection tests also prove that a tampered stage is rejected before a rollback directory or target change is created.

Concrete orchestration requires an explicit maintenance-window flag for greeter components. Non-greeter updates reload systemd only when unit files changed, submit an immediate client-status report when relevant, require the status timer to remain active and always require LightDM to remain active. Command failures propagate into the mandatory health gate and therefore trigger automatic rollback. These commands are covered by a simulated runner and are now used by the guarded CLI installation mode.

Installation requires fresh, distinct absolute directories. Neither directory may already exist:

```bash
sw-badge-client-updater \
  --install \
  --package stumpfworks-client-1.2.1-linux-amd64.zip \
  --public-key /etc/stumpfworks-badge/update-release.pub \
  --stage-dir /var/lib/stumpfworks-badge/updates/1.2.1-stage \
  --rollback-dir /var/backups/stumpfworks-badge/client-1.2.1
```

The install mode stages and revalidates the package, creates the complete rollback snapshot before replacing files, and runs component-aware systemd checks. If installation or health validation fails, all files are restored and systemd health recovery runs against the restored state. A greeter component is rejected unless `--allow-lightdm-maintenance` is supplied; with that explicit authorization LightDM is restarted after installation and again after any automatic rollback. An active transient VNC service is rebound with `try-restart`; an inactive service remains inactive. The normal password fallback must be checked during a separately approved production maintenance test.

Before the mandatory service report, the updater atomically writes `/var/lib/stumpfworks-badge/update-state.json`. The bounded state contains only the target release, `success` or `failed`, the UTC timestamp and whether the rollback snapshot exists. The client status reporter sends this optional object with its normal health report. LOGIN01 rejects malformed versions, unknown results and unreasonable timestamps, stores the last accepted outcome and displays it in the registered-client overview. Clients without updater state remain compatible and show “No update reported”.

The first real WYSE01 update test on 27 August 2026 installed only `sw-badge-client-status` from `1.2.0-dev` to signed development release `1.2.0`. The installed payload hash matched the signed artifact, the timer and LightDM remained active, LOGIN01 received version `1.2.0` with all health fields `ok`, and the real rollback snapshot restored successfully in a local simulated root without changing WYSE01.
